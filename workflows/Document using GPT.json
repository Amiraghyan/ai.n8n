Your primary function is to analyze n8n workflow JSON files and create comprehensive, detailed documentation that leaves nothing to assumption.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n### 1. Complete Workflow Analysis\n- Parse and analyze every node in the workflow JSON\n- Document the exact flow path and execution order\n- Identify all connections between nodes\n- Note any conditional logic, loops, or branching\n- Document error handling and retry mechanisms\n\n### 2. Node-by-Node Documentation\nFor each node, document:\n- **Node Type**: Exact node type and version\n- **Node Name**: As defined in the workflow\n- **Purpose**: What this node accomplishes\n- **Configuration**: All parameters, settings, and options\n- **Input Requirements**: What data/format this node expects\n- **Output Structure**: What data this node produces\n- **Transformations**: Any data manipulation performed\n- **Credentials**: Authentication methods used (without exposing secrets)\n- **Error Handling**: How failures are managed\n\n### 3. Data Flow Documentation\n- **Input Sources**: Where data enters the workflow\n- **Data Transformations**: How data changes at each step\n- **Variable Usage**: All variables set, modified, or referenced\n- **Data Mapping**: Field mappings and data structure changes\n- **Output Destinations**: Where final data is sent or stored\n\n### 4. Technical Specifications\n- **Trigger Mechanisms**: How the workflow is initiated\n- **Scheduling**: Any time-based executions\n- **Dependencies**: External services, APIs, or resources required\n- **Environment Variables**: Any environment-specific configurations\n- **Webhook Endpoints**: URLs and expected payloads\n- **Database Connections**: Tables, queries, or operations performed\n\n## Documentation Standards\n\n### Accuracy Requirements\n- Quote exact parameter names and values from the JSON\n- Use precise technical terminology\n- Include actual field names, not generic descriptions\n- Document exact API endpoints and HTTP methods\n- Note specific version numbers and configurations\n\n### Detail Level\n- Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of this workflow\n- Explain the business logic behind each operation\n- Document edge cases and exception handling\n- Include all conditional paths and their triggers\n- Note any hardcoded values or constants\n\n### Structure Requirements\n1. **Executive Summary**: High-level workflow purpose and outcome\n2. **Workflow Overview**: Visual description of the flow\n3. **Detailed Node Analysis**: Step-by-step breakdown\n4. **Data Flow Diagram**: Input → Processing → Output\n5. **Configuration Summary**: All settings and parameters\n6. **Dependencies & Requirements**: External resources needed\n7. **Error Scenarios**: Potential failure points and handling\n8. **Maintenance Notes**: Update requirements and considerations\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\n\n### What to Document\n- Every parameter value, even if it seems obvious\n- All HTTP headers, query parameters, and request bodies\n- Exact JSON paths and field references\n- All mathematical operations or data calculations\n- Every condition, filter, or logic gate\n- Timeout settings, retry logic, and rate limiting\n- All integrations with external services\n\n### What NOT to Assume\n- Don't assume the purpose of unnamed or generically named nodes\n- Don't assume data formats without verification\n- Don't assume error handling exists if not explicitly configured\n- Don't assume field mappings are self-explanatory\n- Don't assume the reader knows the external services being used\n\n### Quality Checks\n- Verify all node connections are documented\n- Ensure all data inputs and outputs are tracked\n- Confirm all configuration parameters are captured\n- Validate that the execution flow is clearly explained\n- Check that all external dependencies are identified\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide documentation in clear, structured markdown format with:\n- Hierarchical headings for easy navigation\n- Code blocks for JSON snippets and configurations\n- Tables for parameter listings\n- Bullet points for step-by-step processes\n- Diagrams or flowcharts when helpful (described textually)\n\nRemember: Your documentation should enable any developer to understand, maintain, modify, or recreate this workflow without needing to reverse-engineer the JSON file themselves.",

Executive Summary\n\nThe “Weekly Email Agent Reporting” workflow automatically compiles a summary of all email and website chatbot conversations from the past week. Every Monday morning, it creates easily readable reports highlighting new leads, meeting bookings, and important client engagements—then delivers these as PDF attachments to the management team. This ensures that leaders have a clear, up-to-date view of client communications and follow-ups without manual effort.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Process Walkthrough\n\n**Starting Point:**  \nCurrently, reviewing a week of emails and chat conversations to identify sales opportunities, client needs, or missed messages is time-consuming and prone to oversight.\n\n**The Journey:**  \n- Every Monday at 9 AM, the workflow wakes up automatically with no input required.\n- It retrieves all emails and chatbot conversations from the last 7 days, focusing on external contacts (not internal staff).\n- For emails: it gathers each client thread, checks if meetings have been explicitly confirmed, extracts the lead source (such as “website form” or “referral”), and notes the client’s needs and level of urgency.\n- For the website chatbot: it summarizes each conversation, notes the potential client’s interests, engagement levels, and if a meeting was booked or if a follow-up is required.\n- The workflow then uses advanced analysis to create clear, professional reports summarizing each conversation in business-friendly sections (with priorities, next steps, and meeting statuses).\n\n**End Result:**  \n- Two branded PDF summaries (one for email, one for chatbot) are generated and sent straight to management by email—every week, without fail.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Business Benefits & Value\n\n### Time Savings  \n- **Manual review eliminated**: No more searching emails and chat logs.\n- **Hours saved every week**: Automates a task that would take staff several hours.\n- **No forgetting**: The report is created and delivered at the same time each week—no human reminders needed.\n\n### Accuracy Improvements  \n- Reduces the chance of overlooking important leads or missing follow-ups.\n- Consistently checks for clear “meeting confirmed” language to avoid mistakes in scheduling tracking.\n- Ensures all client sources and statuses are logged for analysis.\n\n### Efficiency Gains  \n- Faster identification of high-priority leads and urgent tasks.\n- Gives management an instant overview of the sales and client engagement pipeline.\n- Enables ongoing operation with no manual intervention.\n\n### Cost Benefits  \n- Saves staff time, allowing more focus on value-added activities (like following up or closing deals).\n- Reduces the need for dedicated admin work to collate reports.\n- Helps avoid lost revenue from missed meetings or leads not being followed up.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Real-World Impact\n\n### For End Users (Client Managers, Sales, Support)\n- Daily workload becomes lighter; no need to check many inboxes or threads.\n- Missed opportunities and important deadlines (like tax dates) are less likely.\n- Frustrations from manual tracking or lost information are removed.\n\n### For Teams  \n- Improves collaboration: everyone is working from the same, up-to-date picture of the week’s client interactions.\n- Reduces duplicated effort: no more multiple people reviewing the same information.\n- Provides a single source of truth for meetings, follow-ups, and lead quality.\n\n### For Management  \n- Weekly “at a glance” visibility into all active conversations and engagement trends.\n- Easy identification of where sales or client service effort should be focused.\n- Provides data and reports suitable for management meetings and performance tracking.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Limitations & Considerations\n\n### What This Workflow Cannot Do  \n- Cannot handle complex or nuanced situations that require human judgment or interpretation beyond the data found in emails/chat.\n- Does not replace interpersonal sales or client relationship skill—only summarizes the evidence.\n- Will not catch non-digital communications (e.g., phone calls not documented via email/chat).\n\n### Dependencies  \n- Relies on access to Gmail and chat databases (which must be maintained and available).\n- AI-powered summaries depend on the clarity of email and chat content—if information is missing in messages, summaries may reflect that.\n- Teams must still act on the “next actions” the report highlights.\n\n### Potential Challenges  \n- Occasional need for technical support if email or database connections change.\n- Staff must be comfortable reading reports delivered by email (PDFs).\n- Some edge cases (e.g., new contact types) may require minor adjustments.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Success Metrics\n\n- **Hours of manual admin time saved each week** (estimate: 2-5 hours).\n- **Number of leads and meetings tracked with no missed follow-ups** (improved reliability).\n- **Faster response times** to new and high-priority clients, as highlighted in reports.\n- **Management satisfaction**: Team leaders always know the status of leads and meetings at the start of each week.\n- **Potential increase in closed business** due to more reliable lead tracking and prioritization.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThis automation ensures that no lead, meeting, or urgent client task slips through the cracks. It transforms raw communication into clear weekly intelligence, making The Tax Guys more responsive, efficient, and confident in their client management—all while saving time and reducing admin burden.\n\n---",
